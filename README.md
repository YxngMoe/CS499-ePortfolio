# CS499-ePortfolio

# Professional Self-Assessment

As a senior at Southern New Hampshire University, my time in the Computer Science department has been transformative, providing me with the skills, knowledge, and experiences required to flourish in the world of computing. Completing my curriculum and establishing my ePortfolio has allowed me to highlight my skills, shape my professional objectives and values, and prepare myself to join the industry as a highly marketable individual in the field of computer science.

Throughout my education, I have improved my teamwork skills, communicated successfully with stakeholders, and applied fundamental ideas in data structures and algorithms. For example, in my CS360 course, I collaborated with my colleagues to design and construct a full-stack mobile application using Java. This experience not only honed my technical abilities, but it also showed me the value of good communication and teamwork in meeting project objectives.

Furthermore, my education in software engineering and databases has provided me with the knowledge and abilities required to build and construct sophisticated software applications. For example, in my CS340 course, I worked on a web application dashboard for an animal shelter, using my expertise of Python, Flask, and MongoDB to develop and deploy a user-friendly dashboard that improved data processing efficiency.

Furthermore, my curriculum has concentrated on security, and I've learnt the necessity of protecting software systems from vulnerabilities and attacks. I've proved my abilities to increase software security and performance through projects such as adding validation and binary search for bid ID retrieval to a C++ program.

In summary, my artifacts, which include the Java-based mobile application, the C++ binary search tree program, and the online application dashboard, demonstrate my whole spectrum of computer science skills and abilities. They emphasize my experience in software design and engineering, my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, and my dedication to software security and performance.

As I prepare to join the industry, I am certain that my experiences at Southern New Hampshire University have equipped me to face the challenges of the computer science sector and contribute meaningfully to any firm. I am delighted about the prospects that await me, and I look forward to using my talents and experience to address hard issues in computer science.

The Computer Science curriculum was crucial in my career development, equipping me to make a significant contribution to the area. As I near the end of my voyage, I am reminded of a mountain climber approaching the top, drawing on my motivation and focus. Creating my ePortfolio has been a huge accomplishment, demonstrating my capacity to apply creative methodologies. For example, I've developed functionality for importing CSV data files into MongoDB using Python's PyMongo driver, the Dash framework, and Python source code, showcasing my ability to give value through computer solutions. In addition, my ePortfolio demonstrates my competence in creating and assessing computer solutions utilizing algorithmic principles and industry standards, with a focus on security throughout the development process. Looking ahead, I am excited about expanding.


# artifact 1 
Milestone 2 - Software Design/Engineering (artifact 1)

The selected artifact is a Java-based mobile application created as part of the CS360 course around a semester ago. This course focused on developing a full-stack mobile application using simple methods to create a fully working application.

This artifact's placement in my ePortfolio is justified by its application to software design and engineering. It demonstrates my expertise in full-stack application development, namely Java programming and mobile development. The artifact was enhanced by including validation and small changes to increase usability, particularly in the backend functionality.

With this update, I hoped to achieve the course objectives outlined in Module One, which included showing expertise in software design and engineering concepts. The upgrades to the outcome-coverage plans included improvements to the application's usability and security features.

Reflecting on the process of improving the artifact, I gained important lessons about user validation and backend development. The hurdles were guaranteeing interoperability across several devices and striking a balance between introducing new functionality and keeping the application's interface simple. Overall, the experience gave a good understanding of software design and engineering fundamentals.

All changes were made in MainActivity.Java file because thats where the validation enhancements needed to be made and for the design to better and more robust.

# artifact 2 
cs260-artifact-2
Milestone 3

The artifact for your ePortfolio is a C++ application that uses a binary search tree data structure to store bid information and allows the user to rapidly search for a certain bid ID. It was first developed in February 2023 for CS 260. I chose this item for my ePortfolio because it exhibits my knowledge of C++ and ability to apply sorting algorithms to bespoke data structures. Specifically, the artifact demonstrates my ability to create and deconstruct bespoke data structures, as well as my ability to apply complicated logic. Especially with technical interviews being based on these type of algorithms it was great practice and achieved successfully

The artifact was improved by incorporating validation and binary search for quicker bid ID retrieval. This enhances the program's usefulness and performance while demonstrating your expertise in algorithm design and data structures. The upgrades also show your ability to improve old code to fit new needs.

Through enhancing and modifying the artifact, I discovered the importance of memory management in C++ and how it might affect application performance. I also acquired experience adding new features to an existing codebase, which improved my problem-solving abilities. One of the difficulties I encountered was ensuring that the new features worked easily with the current codebase while preserving the effectiveness of the binary search tree technique.

# artifact 3 
cs340-artifact-3
Grazioso Salvare Animal Shelter's web application dashboard.
It was produced last semester for the CS340 class. The dashboard allows users to choose a rescue type, filter data in a table, and examine accompanying charts and maps. This artifact demonstrates my software development talents, including Python, Dash, Flask, MongoDB, and Plotly. The inclusion of the method increases data processing efficiency, proving my ability to optimize code for performance.

The upgrade supports the course objectives of designing database solutions and accomplishing project goals. The method enhances data processing, which is critical to database operations and project efficiency.

Throughout the improvement process, I learnt about algorithm optimization and its effect on data processing speed. I encountered difficulties in effortlessly incorporating the algorithm into the current software while ensuring that it enhanced overall speed without creating mistakes. Overall, this upgrade project was a fantastic learning opportunity that helped me improve my abilities in database administration, algorithm optimization, and software development.
